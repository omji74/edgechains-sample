# Groq Edgechain Sample Project

This is a sample project that uses the Groq API to generate responses based on user queries. The project is built using React and Axios for making API requests.

## Features

- User can input a query prompt.
- The application sends the prompt to the Groq API and displays the response.
- If the prompt is longer than 100 characters, a "Read More" / "Read Less" button is displayed to toggle the full view of the prompt.
